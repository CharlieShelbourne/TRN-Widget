## Project decription
This Pseudo code was written as a highlevel desing for the build of the software element of a network test device wiggit. The device was built by myself during a 10 week summer internship, to test the network (network data packets) to train number boards on London Undergraound's picaddility line. The code was run by an arduino (micro controller). I made three devices in total and they remain the single means of testing the train numberboard of the picaddility line. 

Unfortunitly I am struggling to find the acutal code files, which were written in a C/C++ variant language.
